## Use already builded version
If you need vanilla don't put any args, if you need modded version put `--plus`

## Build

If you want build project step by this commands:

   Install:
   > electron@31.3.1

   > electron-builder@24.13.3

   > electron-squirrel-startup@1.0.1

   Then run:
   > npm run build 
   OR:
   >npm start

## How run modded verison?
For running modded version, you need install same as in build requirements:
   > electron@31.3.1

   > electron-builder@24.13.3
